# Day 76: Advanced Git Workflows

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Git flow methodology
- Trunk-based development
- Feature branch strategies
- Release management

## 🌊 Git Flow

A branching model for managing releases:

```bash
# Main branches
main (production)
develop (integration)

# Supporting branches
feature/feature-name
release/version
hotfix/urgent-fix
```

## 🚀 Trunk-Based Development

- Single main branch
- Short-lived feature branches
- Continuous integration
- Frequent small commits

## 🔄 Branching Strategies

- **Feature Branches:** `feature/user-authentication`
- **Release Branches:** `release/v1.2.0`
- **Hotfix Branches:** `hotfix/security-patch`

## 📋 Git Commands

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Rebase to keep history clean
git rebase main

# Squash commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

## ✅ Best Practices

- Keep branches short-lived
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Regular integration with main

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Set up Git flow for a project
- Practice trunk-based development

## ❓ Assessment

- What is the difference between Git flow and trunk-based development?
- When would you use a hotfix branch?
