# Day 68: Advanced Docker

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Multi-stage builds
- Docker Compose
- Container optimization
- Security best practices

## 🏗️ Multi-stage Builds

Reduce image size and improve security:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:16 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM node:16-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## 🐙 Docker Compose

Manage multi-container applications:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret
```

## ⚡ Container Optimization

- Use smaller base images (alpine)
- Minimize layers
- Use .dockerignore

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

- Run as non-root user
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Use minimal base images

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Create a multi-stage Dockerfile
- Set up a Docker Compose application with database

## ❓ Assessment

- What are the benefits of multi-stage builds?
- How does Docker Compose help?
