3. **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Comprehensive DR strategy and implementation
4. **Advanced Monitoring**: Distributed tracing and custom metrics
5. **Leadership Skills**: Team management and DevOps transformation experience
6. **Career Portfolio**: Resume, projects, and networking connections

## üõ†Ô∏è Expert Tools & Practices

- **SRE Tools**: SLI/SLO frameworks, error budget tracking
- **Performance Tools**: Load testing, profiling, optimization
- **Monitoring**: Distributed tracing, custom metrics, alerting
- **Leadership**: Team building, change management, communication
- **Career Tools**: Resume building, networking, certification

## üìä SRE Fundamentals

### **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**

```yaml
# Example SLO definition
apiVersion: monitoring.googleapis.com/v1
kind: ServiceLevelObjective
metadata:
  name: api-availability
spec:
  service: api-service
  slos:
    - name: availability
      goal: 0.999 # 99.9% availability
      sli:
        requestBased:
          goodTotalRatio:
            goodServiceFilter: 'metric.type="custom.googleapis.com/api/requests"'
            totalServiceFilter: 'metric.type="custom.googleapis.com/api/requests"'
```

### **Error Budgets**

- **Error Budget**: 1 - SLO target
- **Budget Consumption**: Track how much error budget is consumed
- **Budget Recovery**: Implement practices to recover error budget
- **Budget Alerting**: Alert when budget is at risk

### **SLI Examples**

- **Availability**: Uptime percentage
- **Latency**: Response time percentiles
- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests

## üöÄ Scalability Patterns

### **Horizontal Scaling**

```yaml
# Kubernetes HPA example
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: myapp-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: myapp
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 70
```

### **Load Balancing Strategies**

- **Round Robin**: Distribute requests evenly
- **Least Connections**: Send to least busy server
- **IP Hash**: Consistent routing based on IP
- **Weighted Round Robin**: Assign weights to servers

## üîÑ High Availability Patterns

### **Multi-Region Deployment**

```yaml
# Multi-region Kubernetes deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp
  labels:
    app: myapp
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp
          image: myapp:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
          livenessProbe:
            httpGet:
              path: /health
              port: 8080
            initialDelaySeconds: 30
            periodSeconds: 10
```
