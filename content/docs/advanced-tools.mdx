- **SonarQube**: Code quality and security
- **Vault**: Secrets management
- **ArgoCD/Flux**: GitOps deployment
- **AWS Lambda/Azure Functions**: Serverless computing
- **Advanced Kubernetes**: Operators, CRDs, RBAC

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### **Three Pillars of Observability**

- **Logs**: Structured logging for debugging and auditing
- **Metrics**: Time-series data for performance monitoring
- **Traces**: Distributed tracing for request flow analysis

### **Monitoring Stack**

```
Application → Prometheus → Grafana → Alerting
     ↓
   Logs → Elasticsearch → Kibana → Log Analysis
     ↓
  Traces → Jaeger → Distributed Tracing
```

### **Key Metrics to Monitor**

- **Application Metrics**: Response time, error rate, throughput
- **Infrastructure Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network
- **Business Metrics**: User engagement, revenue, conversions
- **Security Metrics**: Failed logins, suspicious activities

## 🔒 DevSecOps Integration

### **Security in CI/CD Pipeline**

```
Code → Static Analysis → Build → Security Scan → Test → Deploy → Runtime Protection
```

### **Security Tools Integration**

- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing
- **DAST**: Dynamic Application Security Testing
- **SCA**: Software Composition Analysis
- **Container Scanning**: Image vulnerability scanning
- **Infrastructure Scanning**: IaC security validation

### **Secrets Management**

- **HashiCorp Vault**: Centralized secrets management
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Cloud-native secrets storage
- **Azure Key Vault**: Microsoft's secrets management
- **Kubernetes Secrets**: Native K8s secrets (basic)

## 🚀 Advanced Deployment Strategies

### **Blue-Green Deployment**

```yaml
# Kubernetes Blue-Green example
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-blue
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
      version: blue
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
        version: blue
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp
          image: myapp:blue
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

### **Canary Deployment**

```yaml
# Canary deployment with traffic splitting
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: canary-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary: "true"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/canary-weight: "10"

    kind: Application
    plural: applications
    singular: application
  scope: Namespaced
  versions:
    - name: v1
      served: true
      storage: true
      schema:
        openAPIV3Schema:
          type: object
          properties:
            spec:
              type: object
              properties:
                replicas:
                  type: integer
```

### **Kubernetes Operators**

- **Operator Pattern**: Extend Kubernetes with custom controllers
- **Helm Charts**: Package and deploy applications
- **StatefulSets**: Stateful applications with persistent storage
- **DaemonSets**: Run pods on all nodes
- **Jobs & CronJobs**: Batch processing and scheduled tasks

## 🔄 GitOps Workflow

### **ArgoCD Example**

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: myapp
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/myorg/myapp
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: k8s
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: production
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
```
