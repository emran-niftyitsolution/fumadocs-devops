# Day 28: Monitoring Fundamentals

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Why monitoring is essential in DevOps
- Types of monitoring (infrastructure, application, network)
- Key metrics: CPU, memory, disk, latency, error rate
- Alerting basics

## 🧠 Why Monitoring Matters

Monitoring provides visibility into your systems, allowing you to detect issues before they impact users. It is a core pillar of reliability.

## 🛠️ Types of Monitoring

- **Infrastructure Monitoring:** Tracks servers, VMs, containers (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- **Application Monitoring:** Tracks app health (response time, error rate, throughput)
- **Network Monitoring:** Tracks connectivity, bandwidth, packet loss

## 📊 Key Metrics

- **CPU Usage:** High usage may indicate resource contention
- **Memory Usage:** Memory leaks or insufficient memory
- **Disk I/O:** Slow disks can bottleneck apps
- **Latency:** Time taken to serve requests
- **Error Rate:** Percentage of failed requests

## 🚨 Alerting Basics

Set up alerts for thresholds (e.g., CPU > 90%, error rate > 1%). Use tools like Prometheus Alertmanager, PagerDuty, or Opsgenie.

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Identify 3 key metrics for your current project
- Set up a basic alert (even if just a script that prints a warning)

## ❓ Assessment

- What is the difference between monitoring and logging?
- Name two types of monitoring and give an example metric for each.
