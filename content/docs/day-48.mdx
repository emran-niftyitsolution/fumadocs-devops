# Day 48: Network Security

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Firewalls and security groups
- Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)
- Network segmentation

## 🔥 Firewalls & Security Groups

- Control inbound/outbound traffic
- Use default-deny, allow only necessary ports

## 🌐 VPCs

- Isolated network environments in the cloud
- Subnets, route tables, gateways

## 🧩 Network Segmentation

- Separate environments (prod, dev, test)
- Limit blast radius of breaches

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Create a security group with least privilege rules
- Diagram a segmented network

## ❓ Assessment

- What is a VPC?
