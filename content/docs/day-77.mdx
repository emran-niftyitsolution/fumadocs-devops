# Day 77: Infrastructure as Code Best Practices

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- IaC design patterns
- Testing infrastructure code
- Security and compliance
- Documentation standards

## 🏗️ Design Patterns

- **Modular Design:** Reusable components
- **Environment Parity:** Consistent across dev/staging/prod
- **Immutable Infrastructure:** Replace, don't modify

## 🧪 Testing Strategies

```hcl
# Terraform test example
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = "t3.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "web-server"
  }
}
```

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

- Use IAM roles and policies
- Encrypt sensitive data
- Implement least privilege
- Regular security scanning

## 📚 Documentation

- README files for modules
- Architecture diagrams
- Change logs
- Runbooks

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Create a reusable Terraform module
- Write tests for infrastructure code

## ❓ Assessment

- What is immutable infrastructure?
- Why test infrastructure code?
