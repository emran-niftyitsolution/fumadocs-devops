# Day 83: Chaos Engineering

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Chaos engineering principles
- Tools and frameworks
- Experiment design
- Safety practices

## 🌪️ What is Chaos Engineering?

The discipline of experimenting on a distributed system to build confidence in its capability to withstand turbulent conditions.

## 🔬 Principles

1. **Steady State:** Define normal system behavior
2. **Hypothesis:** Predict what will happen
3. **Blast Radius:** Limit impact of experiments
4. **Automation:** Run experiments continuously

## 🛠️ Tools

- **Chaos Monkey:** Netflix's original tool
- **Gremlin:** Commercial chaos engineering platform
- **Litmus Chaos:** Kubernetes-native chaos engineering
- **Chaos Toolkit:** Open-source framework

## 🧪 Experiment Examples

```yaml
# Litmus Chaos experiment
apiVersion: litmuschaos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ChaosEngine
metadata:
  name: pod-delete
spec:
  appinfo:
    appns: default
    applabel: app=nginx
    appkind: deployment
  jobCleanUpPolicy: retain
  experiments:
    - name: pod-delete
      spec:
        components:
          env:
            - name: TOTAL_CHAOS_DURATION
              value: "30"
```

## 🛡️ Safety Practices

- Run in non-production first
- Have rollback procedures
- Monitor system health
- Set time limits

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Design a chaos experiment
- Run a simple failure injection

## ❓ Assessment

- What are the four principles of chaos engineering?
- Why is blast radius important?
