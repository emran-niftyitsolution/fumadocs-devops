# Day 81: Service Mesh

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- What is a service mesh?
- Istio fundamentals
- Traffic management
- Observability patterns

## 🌐 What is a Service Mesh?

A dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication.

## 🚀 Istio Components

- **Control Plane:** istiod (pilot, citadel, galley)
- **Data Plane:** Envoy proxy sidecars
- **Gateway:** Ingress/egress traffic

## 🛣️ Traffic Management

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
    - reviews
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v1
          weight: 75
        - destination:
            host: reviews
            subset: v2
          weight: 25
```

## 📊 Observability

- **Distributed Tracing:** Jaeger, Zipkin
- **Metrics:** Prometheus integration
- **Logging:** Centralized log collection

## 🔒 Security

- **mTLS:** Mutual TLS encryption
- **Authorization:** Service-to-service policies
- **Certificate Management:** Automatic rotation

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Deploy Istio on Kubernetes
- Configure traffic splitting

## ❓ Assessment

- What is the purpose of a service mesh?
- Name Istio components.
