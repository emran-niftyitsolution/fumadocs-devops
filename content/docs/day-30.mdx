# Day 30: Prometheus Deep Dive

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Prometheus architecture
- Writing PromQL queries
- Setting up exporters
- Alerting with Alertmanager

## 🏗️ Prometheus Architecture

- **Prometheus Server:** Scrapes metrics from targets
- **Exporters:** Expose metrics (e.g., node_exporter, blackbox_exporter)
- **Alertmanager:** Handles alerts
- **Pushgateway:** For short-lived jobs

## 🔍 PromQL Basics

PromQL is the query language for Prometheus. Example:

```txt
rate(http_requests_total[5m])
```

## 🛠️ Hands-on Exercise

- Install Prometheus locally or use a demo site
- Add node_exporter and view metrics
- Write a PromQL query to get CPU usage

## ❓ Assessment

- What is an exporter in Prometheus?
- Write a PromQL query to get the average memory usage over 1 hour.
