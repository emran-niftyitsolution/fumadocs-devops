# Day 34: Distributed Tracing

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- What is distributed tracing?
- How traces are generated and collected
- Tools for tracing

## 🕵️ What is Distributed Tracing?

Tracks a request as it moves through multiple services. Essential for debugging microservices.

## 🛠️ How Traces Work

- Each service adds a trace ID to requests
- Tools collect and visualize traces

## 🧰 Tools

- Jaeger
- Zipkin
- OpenTelemetry

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Draw a trace for a user login request across 3 services
- Try a tracing demo (Jaeger or Zipkin)

## ❓ Assessment

- Why is distributed tracing important?
- Name a tool for distributed tracing.
