# Day 39: Chaos Engineering

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- What is chaos engineering?
- Tools for chaos testing
- Designing chaos experiments

## 🌀 What is Chaos Engineering?

Intentionally inject failures to test system resilience.

## 🛠️ Tools

- **Chaos Monkey:** Randomly terminates instances
- **Gremlin:** Controlled chaos experiments
- **LitmusChaos:** Kubernetes-native chaos

## 🧪 Designing Experiments

- Define steady state
- Inject failure (kill pod, network loss)
- Observe and learn

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Design a simple chaos experiment for a web app

## ❓ Assessment

- What is the goal of chaos engineering?
- Name a chaos engineering tool.
