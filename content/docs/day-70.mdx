# Day 70: Performance Testing

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Types of performance testing
- Load testing tools
- Interpreting results
- Performance optimization

## 📊 Types of Performance Testing

- **Load Testing:** Normal expected load
- **Stress Testing:** Beyond normal capacity
- **Spike Testing:** Sudden load increases
- **Volume Testing:** Large amounts of data

## 🛠️ Tools

- **Apache JMeter:** GUI-based load testing
- **k6:** Modern load testing tool
- **Artillery:** Lightweight performance testing

## 📈 Example k6 Test

```javascript
import http from "k6/http";
import { check } from "k6";

export let options = {
  vus: 10,
  duration: "30s",
};

export default function () {
  let res = http.get("https://httpbin.org/");
  check(res, {
    "status is 200": (r) => r.status === 200,
  });
}
```

## 🔍 Interpreting Results

- Response time percentiles
- Throughput (requests per second)
- Error rates

## ⚡ Optimization Strategies

- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies
- Content delivery networks (CDNs)

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Run a load test using JMeter or k6
- Identify performance bottlenecks

## ❓ Assessment

- What is the difference between load and stress testing?
- Name a performance testing tool.
