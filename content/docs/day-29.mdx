# Day 29: Metrics, Logs, and Traces

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- The three pillars of observability
- How metrics, logs, and traces differ and complement each other
- Tools for each pillar

## 📏 Metrics

Quantitative measurements (e.g., CPU usage, request count). Used for dashboards and alerting.

## 📜 Logs

Textual records of events (e.g., errors, warnings, info). Useful for debugging and auditing.

## 🕵️ Traces

Show the path of a request through distributed systems. Useful for finding bottlenecks and latency sources.

## 🛠️ Tools

- **Metrics:** Prometheus, Datadog
- **Logs:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Loki
- **Traces:** Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Find a log file on your system and identify an error event
- Sketch a simple trace for a web request (draw or describe the steps)

## ❓ Assessment

- What is a trace, and why is it important in microservices?
- Give an example of a metric and a log from a web server.
