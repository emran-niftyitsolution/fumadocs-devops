# Day 2: Variables and Data Types

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Declaring variables with `let`, `const`, and `var`
- JavaScript data types
- Type coercion basics

## 📝 Declaring Variables

- `let`: Block-scoped, can be reassigned
- `const`: Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned
- `var`: Function-scoped, avoid in modern code

```js
let name = "Alice";
const pi = 3.14;
var age = 30;
```

## 📦 Data Types

- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Null
- Undefined
- Object
- Symbol (ES6+)

```js
let str = "hello";
let num = 42;
let isActive = true;
let nothing = null;
let notDefined;
let obj = { key: "value" };
```

## 🔄 Type Coercion

JavaScript automatically converts types in some situations:

```js
console.log("5" + 1); // '51'
console.log("5" - 1); // 4
```

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Declare variables using `let` and `const`
- Try different data types in the console

## ❓ Assessment

- What is the difference between `let` and `var`?
- Name three JavaScript data types.
