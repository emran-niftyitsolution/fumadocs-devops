# Day 5: Loops - for, while, do...while

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- `do...while` loops
- Loop control: `break` and `continue`

## 🔁 for Loop

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

## 🔄 while Loop

```js
let n = 0;
while (n < 3) {
  console.log(n);
  n++;
}
```

## 🔂 do...while Loop

```js
let x = 0;
do {
  console.log(x);
  x++;
} while (x < 2);
```

## ⏹️ break and continue

- `break`: Exit the loop
- `continue`: Skip to next iteration

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Print numbers 1 to 10 using a `for` loop
- Use a `while` loop to sum numbers until a condition is met

## ❓ Assessment

- What is the difference between `for` and `while` loops?
- When would you use `break`?
