# Day 9: Scope and Closures

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Global, function, and block scope
- Lexical scope
- Closures and their uses

## 🌍 Scope

- **Global Scope:** Variables declared outside any function
- **Function Scope:** Variables declared inside a function
- **Block Scope:** Variables declared with `let` or `const` inside `{}`

```js
let globalVar = "I am global";
function testScope() {
  let localVar = "I am local";
  if (true) {
    let blockVar = "I am block-scoped";
  }
}
```

## 🔗 Lexical Scope

Functions remember the scope in which they were created.

## 🔒 Closures

A closure is a function that remembers its outer variables:

```js
function makeCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function () {
    count++;
    return count;
  };
}
let counter = makeCounter();
console.log(counter()); // 1
console.log(counter()); // 2
```

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Write a function that returns another function (closure)
- Test variable scope in the console

## ❓ Assessment

- What is a closure?
- What is block scope?
