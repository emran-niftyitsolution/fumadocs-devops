# Day 86: Advanced Networking

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Network policies
- Load balancing strategies
- Service discovery
- Network security

## 🛡️ Network Policies

Control traffic between pods:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
    - Egress
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: frontend
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: backend
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 8080
```

## ⚖️ Load Balancing

- **Round Robin:** Distribute requests evenly
- **Least Connections:** Send to least busy server
- **IP Hash:** Consistent hashing
- **Health Checks:** Remove unhealthy instances

## 🔍 Service Discovery

- **DNS-based:** Traditional DNS resolution
- **Service Mesh:** Envoy proxy discovery
- **Consul:** Service discovery and configuration

## 🌐 Network Security

- **TLS Termination:** SSL/TLS at load balancer
- **mTLS:** Mutual TLS between services
- **Network Segmentation:** Isolate network segments

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Create network policies
- Configure load balancing

## ❓ Assessment

- What is a network policy?
- How does service discovery work?
