## üêß Understanding Linux

### What is Linux?

**Linux** is a free, open-source operating system kernel that serves as the foundation for many operating systems (distributions). It's the most popular operating system for servers, cloud computing, and DevOps environments.

**Why Linux for DevOps?**

- **Server Dominance**: 96% of the world's top 1 million servers run Linux
- **Cloud Native**: All major cloud providers use Linux
- **Container Technology**: Docker and Kubernetes are built on Linux
- **Cost Effective**: Free and open-source
- **Customizable**: Highly configurable for specific needs

### Linux Distributions

**Popular Distributions for DevOps:**

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian (Debian-based)
# - Most popular for cloud and containers
# - Excellent package management
# - Large community support

# CentOS/RHEL (Red Hat-based)
# - Enterprise standard
# - Long-term support
# - Security-focused

# Alpine Linux
# - Minimal footprint
# - Perfect for containers
# - Security-focused

# Amazon Linux
# - Optimized for AWS
# - Cloud-native features
# - AWS integration
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Getting Started with the Command Line

### Terminal Basics

**Opening Terminal:**

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
Ctrl + Alt + T

# macOS
Cmd + Space, type "Terminal"

# Windows (WSL)
wsl
```

**Basic Command Structure:**

```bash
command [options] [arguments]

# Examples:
ls -la /home/user
# ls = command
# -la = options (flags)
# /home/user = argument
```

### Essential Commands

**1. Navigation Commands**

```bash
# pwd - Print Working Directory
pwd
# Output: /home/user/current/directory

# ls - List Directory Contents
ls
ls -la  # Show all files (including hidden) with details
ls -lh  # Human-readable file sizes
ls -lt  # Sort by modification time

# cd - Change Directory
cd /home/user
cd ..    # Go to parent directory
cd ~     # Go to home directory
cd -     # Go to previous directory
```

**2. File System Navigation**

```bash
# Understanding Linux File System
/                    # Root directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/            # Essential system binaries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ boot/           # Boot loader files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev/            # Device files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ etc/            # Configuration files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ home/           # User home directories
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/            # Shared libraries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ media/          # Mount points for removable media
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mnt/            # Mount points
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ opt/            # Optional applications

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ usr/            # User programs and data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ var/            # Variable data
```

**3. File and Directory Management**

```bash
# mkdir - Create Directory
mkdir new_directory
mkdir -p parent/child/grandchild  # Create nested directories

# touch - Create Empty File
touch new_file.txt
touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt  # Create multiple files

# cp - Copy Files and Directories
cp source.txt destination.txt
cp -r source_directory/ destination_directory/  # Copy directory recursively

# mv - Move/Rename Files
mv old_name.txt new_name.txt
mv file.txt /path/to/destination/

# rm - Remove Files
rm file.txt
rm -r directory/  # Remove directory recursively
rm -f file.txt    # Force remove (no confirmation)
rm -rf directory/ # Force remove directory (dangerous!)

# rmdir - Remove Empty Directory

```

## üìÅ File System Operations

### File Permissions

**Understanding Permissions:**

```bash
# View file permissions
ls -la
# Output: -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1234 Jan 1 12:00 file.txt
#         ^^^^^^^^^^
#         ||||||||
#         |||||||‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Others: read, write, execute
#         ||||||‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Group: read, write, execute
#         |||||‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ Owner: read, write, execute
#         ||||‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ File type (- = file, d = directory, l = link)

# Permission Types:
# r = read (4)
# w = write (2)
# x = execute (1)
# - = no permission (0)
```

**Changing Permissions:**

```bash
# chmod - Change File Permissions
chmod 755 file.txt        # Numeric notation
chmod u+rwx,g+rx,o+rx file.txt  # Symbolic notation
chmod +x script.sh        # Make executable

# chown - Change File Owner
chown user:group file.txt
chown user file.txt

# chgrp - Change File Group
chgrp group file.txt
```

### File Operations

**Viewing File Contents:**

```bash
# cat - Concatenate and Display
cat file.txt
cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt

# less - View File Page by Page
less large_file.txt
# Navigation: Space (next page), b (previous page), q (quit)

# head - Show First Lines
head file.txt
head -n 10 file.txt  # Show first 10 lines

# tail - Show Last Lines
tail file.txt
tail -n 20 file.txt  # Show last 20 lines
tail -f log.txt      # Follow file (real-time updates)
```

**File Search and Filtering:**

```bash
# find - Find Files
find /path -name "*.txt"           # Find files by name
find /path -type f -mtime -7       # Find files modified in last 7 days
find /path -size +100M             # Find files larger than 100MB

# grep - Search Text
grep "pattern" file.txt
grep -i "pattern" file.txt         # Case-insensitive
grep -r "pattern" directory/       # Recursive search
grep -v "pattern" file.txt         # Invert match (exclude)

# wc - Word Count
wc file.txt                         # Lines, words, characters
wc -l file.txt                     # Line count only
```

# Options:
# -d: delimiter
# -f: field numbers
```

**sed - Stream Editor:**

```bash
# Basic text substitution
sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt
sed 's/old/new/' file.txt          # Replace first occurrence only

# Delete lines
sed '5d' file.txt                  # Delete line 5
sed '1,10d' file.txt              # Delete lines 1-10

# Add text
sed '1i\New line' file.txt        # Insert at line 1
sed '$a\New line' file.txt        # Append at end
```

**awk - Pattern Processing:**

```bash
# Print specific fields
awk '{print $1}' file.txt         # Print first field
awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt     # Print fields 1 and 3

# Conditional processing
awk '$3 > 100 {print $1}' file.txt  # Print field 1 if field 3 > 100

# Field separator
awk -F: '{print $1}' /etc/passwd  # Use : as separator
```

### Advanced Text Processing

**sort - Sort Lines:**

```bash
sort file.txt                      # Sort alphabetically
sort -n file.txt                   # Sort numerically
sort -r file.txt                   # Sort in reverse order
sort -k2 file.txt                  # Sort by second field
```

**uniq - Remove Duplicates:**

```bash
sort file.txt | uniq              # Sort and remove duplicates
uniq -c file.txt                  # Count occurrences
uniq -d file.txt                  # Show only duplicates
```

**paste - Merge Lines:**

```bash
paste file1.txt file2.txt         # Merge files side by side
