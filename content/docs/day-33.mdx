# Day 33: Logging Best Practices

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Structured vs. unstructured logs
- Log levels (info, warn, error, debug)

## 📝 Structured Logging

Use JSON or key-value pairs for logs. Easier to parse and search.

## 🏷️ Log Levels

- **Info:** General events
- **Warn:** Something unexpected, but not breaking
- **Error:** Something failed
- **Debug:** Detailed info for troubleshooting

## 🗃️ Centralized Logging

Aggregate logs from all services in one place (e.g., ELK, Loki).

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise
