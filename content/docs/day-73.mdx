# Day 73: DevOps for Machine Learning

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- What is MLOps?
- ML pipeline automation
- Model deployment strategies
- Monitoring ML models

## 🤖 What is MLOps?

MLOps applies DevOps practices to machine learning workflows.

## 🔄 ML Pipeline Stages

1. Data ingestion and preprocessing
2. Model training and validation
3. Model deployment
4. Monitoring and retraining

## 🚀 Model Deployment

- **Batch Inference:** Process data in batches
- **Real-time Inference:** Serve predictions via API
- **Edge Deployment:** Models on mobile/IoT devices

## 📊 Model Monitoring

- Prediction accuracy drift
- Data drift detection
- Performance metrics

## 🛠️ MLOps Tools

- **MLflow:** Experiment tracking
- **Kubeflow:** ML workflows on Kubernetes
- **DVC:** Data version control

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Set up a simple ML pipeline
- Deploy a model using Flask or FastAPI

## ❓ Assessment

- What is model drift?
- Name an MLOps tool.
