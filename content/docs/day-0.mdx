# Day 0: Welcome to Your DevOps Journey

## üéØ What You'll Learn Today

**Learning Objectives:**

- Understand what DevOps is and why it matters
- Get familiar with the 100-day learning roadmap
- Set up your development environment
- Learn the DevOps mindset and culture
- Understand the tools and technologies you'll master

## üöÄ What is DevOps?

### The Evolution of Software Development

**Traditional Waterfall Model:**

```
Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment
     ‚Üì           ‚Üì         ‚Üì         ‚Üì         ‚Üì
   Months     Months    Months    Months    Months
```

**Problems with Traditional Approach:**

- **Long Release Cycles**: Months between deployments
- **Siloed Teams**: Developers, QA, and Operations work separately
- **Manual Processes**: Error-prone human interventions
- **Blame Culture**: Teams pointing fingers when things go wrong
- **Slow Feedback**: Issues discovered late in the process

**DevOps Solution:**

```
Code ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Monitor ‚Üí Feedback
  ‚Üì      ‚Üì      ‚Üì      ‚Üì       ‚Üì        ‚Üì
Minutes Minutes Minutes Minutes Minutes Minutes
```

### DevOps Definition

**DevOps** is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the systems development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives.

**Key Principles:**

1. **Automation**: Eliminate manual, repetitive tasks
2. **Continuous Integration/Deployment**: Frequent, reliable releases
3. **Monitoring & Feedback**: Real-time visibility into systems
4. **Collaboration**: Cross-functional teams working together
5. **Infrastructure as Code**: Version-controlled infrastructure

## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Essential Tools Installation

**1. Code Editor (VS Code)**

```bash
# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install --cask visual-studio-code

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo snap install code --classic

# Windows
# Download from https://code.visualstudio.com/
```

**2. Terminal & Shell**

```bash
# Install Zsh (macOS/Linux)
# macOS (already installed)
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install zsh

# Install Oh My Zsh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

**3. Git Version Control**

```bash
# macOS
brew install git

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git

# Configure Git
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

**4. Docker Desktop**

```bash
# macOS
brew install --cask docker

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

### Development Environment Setup

**Create Your Workspace:**

```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir ~/devops-journey
cd ~/devops-journey

# Initialize Git repository
git init
echo "# My DevOps Journey" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit: Start of DevOps journey"
```

**VS Code Extensions for DevOps:**

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "ms-vscode.vscode-docker",
    "ms-kubernetes-tools.vscode-kubernetes-tools",
    "hashicorp.terraform",
    "redhat.vscode-yaml",
    "ms-vscode.powershell",
    "ms-python.python",
    "ms-vscode.vscode-json"
  ]
}
```

## üß† The DevOps Mindset

### Cultural Transformation

**From Silos to Collaboration:**

```
Traditional: Dev Team ‚Üê‚Üí QA Team ‚Üê‚Üí Ops Team
DevOps:     Cross-functional DevOps Team
```

**Key Mindset Shifts:**

**1. Shared Responsibility**

- **Before**: "It works on my machine"
- **After**: "Let's make it work everywhere"

**2. Fail Fast, Learn Faster**

- **Before**: Fear of failure leads to slow releases
- **After**: Embrace failure as learning opportunity

**3. Automation First**

- **Before**: Manual processes and tribal knowledge
- **After**: Everything automated and documented

**4. Continuous Improvement**

- **Before**: "We've always done it this way"
- **After**: "How can we improve this process?"

### DevOps Values

**1. Collaboration Over Silos**

```bash
# Example: Cross-functional standup
# Dev: "I need help with deployment scripts"
# Ops: "I'll pair with you on that"
# QA: "Let's automate the testing pipeline"
```

**2. Automation Over Manual Processes**

```yaml
# Before: Manual deployment checklist
# - SSH to server
# - Stop application
# - Copy files
# - Start application
# - Test manually

# After: Automated deployment
deploy:
  script:
    - docker-compose down
    - docker-compose up -d
    - ./health-check.sh
```

**3. Continuous Learning Over Static Knowledge**

- Regular retrospectives
- Knowledge sharing sessions
- Experimentation and innovation
- Learning from failures

## üìä DevOps Metrics & KPIs

### Key Performance Indicators

**1. Deployment Frequency**

```bash
# Track deployments per day/week
# Before DevOps: 1 deployment per month
# After DevOps: 10+ deployments per day
```

**2. Lead Time**

```bash
# Time from code commit to production
# Before: 6 months
# After: 1 hour
```

**3. Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**

```bash
# Time to fix production issues
# Before: 24 hours
# After: 10 minutes
```

**4. Change Failure Rate**

```bash
# Percentage of deployments causing failures
# Before: 30%
# After: <5%
```
