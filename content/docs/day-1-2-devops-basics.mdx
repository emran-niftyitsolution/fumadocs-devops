# üîÑ Day 1-2: DevOps Basics & Culture

## Introduction

Welcome to Days 1-2 of your DevOps journey! Today we'll explore the fundamental concepts of DevOps, its history, culture, and the complete DevOps lifecycle. Understanding these basics is crucial for your entire DevOps career.

## üèóÔ∏è What is DevOps?

### **Definition**

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives.

### **Core Principles**

1. **Collaboration**: Breaking down silos between development and operations
2. **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks and processes
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Learning from failures and iterating
4. **Customer-Centric**: Focusing on delivering value to customers
5. **Lean Management**: Eliminating waste and optimizing flow

## üìö History of DevOps

### **The Traditional Waterfall Model**

```
Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Deployment ‚Üí Maintenance
```

**Problems with Waterfall:**

- Long development cycles (months/years)
- Late discovery of issues
- Difficult to change requirements
- Separate teams with conflicting goals
- Manual deployment processes

### **The Agile Revolution**

Agile methodologies introduced:

- Iterative development
- Continuous feedback
- Cross-functional teams
- Faster delivery cycles

### **The Birth of DevOps**

DevOps emerged in 2009 when Patrick Debois organized the first "DevOps Days" conference. The movement was born from the need to:

- Bridge the gap between development and operations
- Automate deployment processes
- Enable continuous delivery
- Improve collaboration and communication

## üîÑ DevOps Lifecycle

### **The Complete DevOps Pipeline**

```
Plan ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Release ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Operate ‚Üí Monitor
```

### **Detailed Lifecycle Stages**

#### **1. Plan**

- **Requirements gathering**
- **Project planning**
- **Sprint planning**
- **Architecture design**

```yaml
# Example: Sprint Planning
sprint_goals:
  - Implement user authentication
  - Add payment processing
  - Deploy to staging environment
  - Set up monitoring

timeline: 2 weeks
team_members:
  - developers: 3
  - operations: 1
  - qa: 1
```

#### **2. Code**

- **Version control**
- **Code review**
- **Pair programming**
- **Code quality checks**

```bash
# Git workflow example
git checkout -b feature/user-auth
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add user authentication feature"
git push origin feature/user-auth
# Create pull request
```

#### **3. Build**

- **Automated compilation**
- **Dependency management**
- **Artifact creation**
- **Build verification**

```yaml
# Jenkins build pipeline
pipeline {
agent any
stages {
stage('Build') {
steps {
sh 'mvn clean compile'
sh 'mvn package'
}
}
}
}
```

#### **4. Test**

- **Unit testing**
- **Integration testing**
- **Automated testing**
- **Security testing**

```python
# Example test automation
def test_user_authentication():
    user = User("john", "password123")
    assert user.authenticate() == True
    assert user.is_logged_in() == True
```

#### **5. Release**

- **Release planning**
- **Change management**
- **Approval processes**
- **Release notes**

```yaml
# Release configuration
release:
  version: "1.2.0"
  changes:
    - "New user authentication feature"
    - "Bug fixes in payment processing"
    - "Performance improvements"
  deployment_strategy: "blue-green"
```

#### **6. Deploy**

- **Automated deployment**
- **Environment management**
- **Rollback capabilities**
- **Deployment verification**

```bash
# Deployment script
#!/bin/bash
echo "Deploying version $VERSION to $ENVIRONMENT"
kubectl apply -f k8s/
kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp
echo "Deployment completed successfully"
```

#### **7. Operate**

- **System administration**
- **Incident response**
- **Performance monitoring**
- **User support**

```yaml
# Operations monitoring
monitoring:
  metrics:
    - cpu_usage
    - memory_usage
    - response_time
    - error_rate
  alerts:
    - cpu > 80%
    - memory > 85%
    - response_time > 2s
```

#### **8. Monitor**

- **Application monitoring**
- **Infrastructure monitoring**
- **User experience monitoring**
- **Business metrics**

```python
# Monitoring example
import prometheus_client

# Define metrics
request_count = prometheus_client.Counter('http_requests_total', 'Total HTTP requests')
response_time = prometheus_client.Histogram('http_request_duration_seconds', 'HTTP request duration')

# Monitor application
@app.route('/api/users')
def get_users():
    request_count.inc()
    with response_time.time():
        return jsonify(users)
```

## üè¢ DevOps Culture

### **The Three Ways of DevOps**

#### **First Way: Flow**

- **Optimize flow from development to operations**
- **Reduce handoffs and delays**
- **Make work visible**
- **Limit work in progress**

```yaml
# Kanban board example
columns:
  - "To Do"
  - "In Progress"
  - "Testing"
  - "Deploy"
  - "Done"

work_in_progress_limits:
  "In Progress": 3
  "Testing": 2
  "Deploy": 1
```

#### **Second Way: Feedback**

- **Create feedback loops**
- **Learn from failures**
- **Share knowledge**
- **Improve continuously**

```bash
# Post-mortem template
post_mortem:
  incident: "Database connection timeout"
  date: "2024-01-15"
  impact: "High - 30 minutes downtime"
  root_cause: "Connection pool exhaustion"
  action_items:
    - "Implement connection pooling"
    - "Add monitoring alerts"
    - "Update runbooks"
```

#### **Third Way: Continuous Learning**

- **Practice and repetition**
- **Knowledge sharing**
- **Experimentation**
- **Learning from failures**

```yaml
# Learning culture practices
practices:
  - "Weekly knowledge sharing sessions"
  - "Monthly hackathons"
  - "Cross-team pair programming"
  - "Regular retrospectives"
  - "Encouraging experimentation"
```

## üéØ Day 1-2 Exercises

### **Exercise 1: DevOps Assessment**

Evaluate your current organization's DevOps maturity:

```yaml

```

### **Exercise 2: DevOps Lifecycle Mapping**

Map your current development process to the DevOps lifecycle:

```bash
# Current process analysis
echo "Current Development Process:"
echo "1. Requirements gathering (2 weeks)"
echo "2. Development (4 weeks)"
echo "3. Testing (2 weeks)"
echo "4. Deployment (1 week)"
echo "5. Monitoring (ongoing)"

echo "DevOps Transformation Goals:"
echo "1. Continuous integration (daily)"
echo "2. Automated testing (every commit)"
echo "3. Automated deployment (multiple per day)"
echo "4. Continuous monitoring (real-time)"
```

### **Exercise 3: DevOps Culture Assessment**

Assess your team's DevOps culture readiness:

```yaml
# Culture assessment questions
questions:
  collaboration:
    - "Do developers and operations work together?"
    - "Are there shared goals between teams?"
    - "Is knowledge shared across teams?"

  automation:
    - "Are manual processes documented?"
    - "Are there opportunities for automation?"
    - "Is automation prioritized?"

  learning:
    - "Are failures treated as learning opportunities?"
    - "Is experimentation encouraged?"
    - "Are retrospectives held regularly?"
```
