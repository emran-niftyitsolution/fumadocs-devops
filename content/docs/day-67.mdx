## 🎭 Ansible Roles

Roles organize tasks, handlers, variables, and templates:

```yaml

- name: Install Apache
  package:
    name: apache2
    state: present

- name: Start Apache
  service:
    name: apache2
    state: started
```

## 📋 Playbooks

Combine roles and tasks:

```yaml
- name: Deploy web application
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  roles:
    - webserver
