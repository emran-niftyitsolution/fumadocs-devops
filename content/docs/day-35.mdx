# Day 35: SRE Principles

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- What is SRE?
- SRE vs. traditional operations
- Error budgets, SLIs, SLOs
- Toil and automation

## 🧑‍💻 What is SRE?

SRE applies software engineering to operations. Focuses on reliability, automation, and measurable goals.

## ⚖️ SRE vs. Traditional Ops

- SRE: Emphasizes automation, error budgets, and engineering
- Traditional Ops: Manual processes, less focus on measurement

## 📏 Error Budgets, SLIs, SLOs

- **SLI:** Service Level Indicator (e.g., uptime)
- **SLO:** Service Level Objective (target for SLI)
- **Error Budget:** Allowed amount of unreliability

## 🤖 Toil and Automation

- Toil: Manual, repetitive work
- SRE aims to automate toil

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Define an SLI and SLO for a sample service
- Identify a toil task you could automate

## ❓ Assessment

- What is an error budget?
- How does SRE differ from traditional ops?
