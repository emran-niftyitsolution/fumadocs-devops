# Day 72: Feature Flags & Deployment Strategies

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- What are feature flags?
- Deployment strategies
- A/B testing
- Risk mitigation

## 🚩 Feature Flags

Control feature visibility without code deployments:

```javascript
if (featureFlag("new-checkout-flow")) {
  // New checkout process
} else {
  // Legacy checkout process
}
```

## 🚀 Deployment Strategies

- **Blue-Green:** Two identical environments
- **Canary:** Gradual rollout to subset of users
- **Rolling:** Update instances one by one

## 🧪 A/B Testing

- Test different versions with user groups
- Measure performance and user behavior
- Data-driven decisions

## ⚠️ Risk Mitigation

- Instant rollback capabilities
- Gradual feature exposure
- Monitor key metrics

## 🛠️ Tools

- LaunchDarkly
- Unleash
- ConfigCat
- Split.io

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Implement a simple feature flag system
- Design a canary deployment strategy

## ❓ Assessment

- What are the benefits of feature flags?
