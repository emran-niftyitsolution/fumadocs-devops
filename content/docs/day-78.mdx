# Day 78: Advanced CI/CD Pipelines

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Multi-stage pipeline design
- Parallel job execution
- Conditional deployments
- Pipeline optimization

## 🔄 Multi-Stage Pipelines

```yaml
# GitLab CI example
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - security
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm run test
  parallel:
    matrix:
      - NODE_VERSION: "16"
      - NODE_VERSION: "18"
```

## ⚡ Parallel Execution

- Run tests in parallel
- Deploy to multiple environments
- Reduce pipeline duration

## 🎯 Conditional Deployments

```yaml
deploy_production:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - ./deploy.sh
  only:
    - main
  when: manual
```

## 📊 Pipeline Optimization

- Cache dependencies
- Use lightweight base images
- Implement early failure detection

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Create a multi-stage pipeline
- Implement parallel job execution

## ❓ Assessment

- What are the benefits of parallel execution?
- How do conditional deployments work?
