# Day 57: Kubernetes Deployments & Services

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Deployments and ReplicaSets
- Exposing apps with Services
- Rolling updates

## 🚀 Deployments & ReplicaSets

- **Deployment:** Manages ReplicaSets and pods
- **ReplicaSet:** Ensures a specified number of pod replicas

## 🌐 Services

- **ClusterIP:** Internal access
- **NodePort:** Exposes service on each node's IP
- **LoadBalancer:** Exposes service externally

## 🔄 Rolling Updates

- Update pods with zero downtime

## 🛠️ Example Deployment YAML

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.14.2
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

## 📝 Hands-on Exercise

- Deploy an Nginx deployment and expose it with a NodePort service

## ❓ Assessment
